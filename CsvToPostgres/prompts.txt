I want a Tamagui web app with an interface similar to Wordle:
An alphabetic keyboard with enter and backspace keys, below a row of empty squares (the "entry squares").
Tapping on the keyboard displays a letter in the next empty square, and tapping backspace clears the rightmost letter.
On startup the app calls the API's "/game/status" GET endpoint to get a Status object.
Status.NextGuess contains a Guess object, and Guess.Length is the number of entry squares to show.
There is room for 10 squares per row, and the rows are centered.
Above the entry squares row are more static rows of squares (the "guess rows").
Status.Guesses is an array of Guess objects with the contents of the guess rows, from top to bottom.
Guess.Characters is an array of Clue objects that tell how to render the guess rows.
The Clue.Letter is what letter to put in the square, and the Clue.ClueType indicates the color.
The ClueType enums are AllCorrect (orange), CorrectLetter (blue), Incorrect (no color), and Empty (no color). 
In a titlebar at the top of the screen is the Status.ClueWord string in quotes.
Tapping the Enter key calls the "/game/guess" API POST endpoint, sending a JSON payload with a "Guess" key and the characters from the letter squares as a string value.
If the endpoint returns a 400 the response message is displayed above the entry squares, then the entry squares shake, and the message fades out.
If the endpoint returns a 200 the "/status" endpoint is called again and the screen is re-rendered.
If Status.State is Solved, the message "Solved!" is displayed above the entry squares, and the UI becomes nonresponsive.
The State enums are: Solved and Unsolved.

Now I'd like the squares in the GuessRows to line up in columns.
The status.indent value says how many squares are to the left of the center.  
The (GuessRow.offset - 1) value says how many squares the first letter is to the left of the center.

## Deploying the app
Deploy a certificate (e.g., dotnet dev-certs)
Configure .NET API appsettings.json URLs
Configure Next.js URLs
dotnet run (API)
yarn web (UI)
